 ## Part 1:

1. Download the project and import it into IntelliJ Idea
2. Implement the following functions:

        //TODO implement this code
      }

  ```
3. Test your code with 5 different names and verify that the behaviour is correct.
4. Modify your code to also capture from the user the last name.

## Challenge yourself
Add some more functionality to your *CalculatorBrain*:
